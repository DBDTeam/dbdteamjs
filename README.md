# @dbdteam.js
âœ¨ Introducing a compact JavaScript library ([NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) module) designed to streamline the development of Discord bots using the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). While it's in its initial stages, your feedback is invaluable. Should you encounter any bugs, please do not hesitate to notify us. Join our [official Discord server](https://www.dbdteam.xyz/discord) (alternative [link here](https://discord.gg/FTtVXfj)), where you can open a forum in the "support-projects" channel.

# Starting to create the bot
ðŸŽ’ Firstly, it is suggested that you please have knowledge of how to create Discord Applications in [Discord Developers Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications), once you have your application created, follow the following steps (this will be simple, so you should know about Discord Intents too):

1. Get your app token.
2. Invite your bot to a server.

Once you have that done, it's time to start creating the robot using the package. See under.

# Example using MessageContent Intent
```javascript
const {
  Client,
  Intents,
  IntentsBitFields,
  PresenceStatus,
  PresenceTypes,
} require("dbdteamjs");
const $Intents = new IntentsBitFields(
  Intents.Guilds,
  Intents.GuildMembers,
  Intents.GuildMessages,
  Intents.MessageContent
);

const client = new Client({
  token:
    "Here your token",
  intents: $Intents.intents,
  gateway: {
    mobilePlatform: false,
  },
});

client.on("ready", ({ username }) => {
  console.log(`I have successfully logged on to ${username}`);

  client.presence.update({
    activities: [{ name: `Hello world!`, type: PresenceTypes.Competing }],
    since: 0,
    status: PresenceStatus.DND,
  });
});

client.on("messageCreate", async(msg) => {
  if(msg.content?.toLowerCase() === "!hi") {
    msg.reply({
      content: `Hi!`
    })
  }
})
});

client.connect() // Will establish the connection between the robot and the WS.
```
# Example using Interactions
```javascript
import {
  Client,
  IntegrationTypes,
  Intents,
  IntentsBitFields,
  InteractionContexts,
  PresenceStatus,
  PresenceTypes,
} from "dbdteamjs";

const Intents = new IntentsBitFields()

Intents.add("Guilds")
Intents.add("GuildMembers")

const client = new Client({
   token: `HERE GOES THE ROBOT TOKEN`,
   intents: Intents.intents,
   gateway: {
     mobilePlatform: false // Only this if you want the robot to have the online icon on a mobile device.
   }
})

client.on("ready", () => {
   console.log(`I have successfully logged on to ${client.user.username}`)
   client.presence.update({
     activities: [{ name: `Hello world!`, type: PresenceTypes }],
     since: 0,
     status: PresenceStatus
   })

   client.application.commands.set(
    [
      {
        name: "ping",
        description: "Pong!",
        options: [],
        type: InteractionTypes.Slash
      }, //You can add more application commands adding it in the object.
    ]
   )
})

client.on("interactionCreate", async(interaction) => {
   if(interaction.isSlash){
    if(interaction.name === "ping"){
      interaction.makeReply({ content: `Pong!\nLatency: ${client.ping}` })
    }
   }
})

client.connect() // Will establish the connection between the robot and the WS.
```
